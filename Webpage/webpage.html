                 Hey I'm Emily. Since stumbling into HTML and CSS I have become a hopeful soon to be Web Developer. Since being exposed to
                programming, I have found it to be a great mix of creativity and problem solving and have enjoyed the challenges it has provided
                me. Previously visiting websites, I would have no thought about designs, only focus on the loading times. Now I find interest
                in how I would change common websites I visit to improve layouts and user interactivity to provide a better experience. I
                am excited for my future development as a developer so I can make something incredible like the websites I have bookmarked
                for great designs. I hope in the future I can use these as inspiration for my own work that I can be proud of.
            </p>

                I am excited and driven to apply for Founder & Coders as I finally found my calling, a subject and future job prospect that I find engaging, motivating and something that I spend my spare time reading about simply to learn more. After reading up on the course structure, I realised how beneficial the project based format is for my development as learning is far more intuitive from trying something yourself or as part of a team than just reading it from a resource. Peer to peer learning is exciting as it’s inspirational to learn from someone who is excited to share what they have recently learnt. Solutions to problems are also far more likely to be remembered if you’ve had to investigate them as a group as opposed to just being told how to do it.

                 Some of my latest interests in coding have been focusing on learning and developing my skills in CSS Grid and Flexbox. I
                have also been taking Harvard’s CS50 course with a fellow F&C applicant.

                 I have always been interested in science, I studied Medical Neuroscience at University so enjoy reading about new discoveries,
                particularly in the Alzheimer and Dementia fields. I have recently been volunteering with the mental health charity Mind
                to give back to a charity that has helped me in the past. I have also signed up for public speaking workshops as this is
                an area I would like to improve in.
