                 Hey I'm Emily. Since stumbling into HTML and CSS I have become a hopeful soon to be Web Developer. Since being exposed to
                programming, I have found it to be a great mix of creativity and problem solving and have enjoyed the challenges it has provided
                me. Previously visiting websites, I would have no thought about designs, only focus on the loading times. Now I find interest
                in how I would change common websites I visit to improve layouts and user interactivity to provide a better experience. I
                am excited for my future development as a developer so I can make something incredible like the websites I have bookmarked
                for great designs. I hope in the future I can use these as inspiration for my own work that I can be proud of.
            </p>

                I am excited and driven to apply for Founder & Coders as I finally found my calling, a subject and future job prospect that I find engaging, motivating and something that I spend my spare time reading about simply to learn more. After reading up on the course structure, I realised how beneficial the project based format is for my development as learning is far more intuitive from trying something yourself or as part of a team than just reading it from a resource. Peer to peer learning is exciting as it’s inspirational to learn from someone who is excited o share what they have recently learnt. Solutions to problems are also far more likely to be remembered if you’ve had to investigate them as a group as opposed to just being told how to do it.
